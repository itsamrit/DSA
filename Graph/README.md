ðŸ‘‰To convert graph codes for matrix convert for(auto &i:g[c]) to index to where u can move from current. If u can move in all 4 dir the for(int i=0 to 4).
Change 1d visited to 2d visited

ðŸ‘‰Dis from 1source to 1destination always bfs

ðŸ‘‰For all paths from source to destination use dfs.Bfs will be too complex.Use bfs for returning 1 single min/max path. 

ðŸ‘‰As real bridges are always two ways & so as bridges & articulation point are always in two way i,e in undirectional graph

ðŸ‘‰Queue or Priority queue can be applied only to undirected graph.

In topo sort g[a].push_back(b) means a can be done only after b;
