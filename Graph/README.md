ðŸ‘‰For shortest dis between 2 index in matrix use dfs/bfs, In graph bfs.

ðŸ‘‰For shortest dis between 2 group of indexes like island in matrix/graph use dfs+bfs.Find all index of 1st group using dfs & intialize the bfs queue with it.

Using Dfs :U can store all index of group1 & group2 in separete vector & run loop to find dis between all pair & select smallest dis.

ðŸ‘‰To convert graph codes for matrix convert for(auto &i:g[c]) to index to where u can move from current. If u can move in all 4 dir the for(int i=0 to 4).
Change 1d visited to 2d visited


ðŸ‘‰Dis from 1source to 1destination always bfs

ðŸ‘‰For all paths from source to destination use dfs.Bfs will be too complex.Use bfs for returning 1 single min/max path. 

ðŸ‘‰As real bridges are always two ways & so as bridges & articulation point are always in two way i,e in undirectional graph

ðŸ‘‰Queue or Priority queue can be applied only to undirected graph.

In topo sort g[a].push_back(b) means a can be done only after b;
