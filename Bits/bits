Arrow indicates whether left or right shift .If arrow points in left its left shift.
// Use any both right & left shift are used for determining the value of a bit at a particular position.
>>Right shift (removes x bits from LAST)
  1101=11  by 2 
  num>>x = num/(2^x) 

<<Left shift (adds x 0's in LAST)
  1101=110100 by 2
  num<<x = num*(2^x)
  
     use to iterate over every bit & get the value of that bit
     eg: 
     num&(1<<0)  num&(1<<1)   num&(1<<2)
     1101          1101       1101  .....
    &   1         &  10        100
    =   1         =  00      = 100
    =   1            0         1

Dont do if(x&1 ==y&1) because x value changes here instead store a temporary int

 Result of c&b is always smaller than c and b.
  eg 3&14 =2    i.e(2<3 and 2<14)
   In system -: 110 & 101010 = 000110 & 101010 = 000010 = 10 < 110 


~(100)= 001
 
x=4&3 kahi common ki baat ho toh & operator

1>0 in bits.
  
  
  

  
Binary to Decimal conversion :
    string s = "110010"; 
    bitset<32> b(s);
    unsigned long val = b.to_ulong();

Decimal to Binary conversion :
    unsigned long val = 50; 
    bitset<32> b(val);
    string s = b.to_string();


b.flip(i);    b.flip(); / flips whole
NOTE:1) bitset is not array but its element are int. eg: int tmp=x[4]; //1
2) ^ & | can be applied direct to bitset also
3)bitset datatype is array of bool whose indexing start from right
4)Everything must be in ()
4)Greater the num greater the bit representation 
5)1101(2) is used to denote bitset in problems given to u





  
There are n numbers between 0 to 2^n -1  with each n bits.


1 denotes set bit or true and 0 denotes false. 
Compares last bits of two numbers :-
&(same as &&)If both conditions are true(1) then whole condition becomes true(1). 
|(same as ||)If atleast one of the condition is true(1) then whole condition becomes true(1).
(a^b)xor ->If one of condition is true(1) and other is false(0) then whole condition becomes true i,e, gives 1.
  eg: 3^4=100
          110
         =010=2

  ^ of two or more number is always less the smallest number.
