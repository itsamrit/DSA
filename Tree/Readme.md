✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅NORMAL recursion in tree like int dfs() stores all info of left and right childs but to store info of parallel right or left(which are not child of current node) or parent we use &sum or global variable 
https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/
and check why we do parent linking question 
GUESS void is used to check if just current left & right child && int is used to get info of all right subchilds and  left subchilds sum or anything CHECK

👉All questions in binary tree with 1 recursion are dp void & int all Tc =o(n)✅✅

👉Subtree tc o(n*m)

👉There is all left element strictly lesser & right stictly greater than root just like sorted array.

All elements of BST are unique.

👉Never return between loop either at starting or at end (not applicable for dp)
Other wise chaos like binary tree path wrong answers

Both in diameter & lcs u cant store distance or node using & of left & right or not do
lca is also dp cant be solved using void

👉 In tree Bfs we dont write loop for all conneted nodes instead we directlly write algo for left & right

👉 Pass & in tree just like we pass normally void dfs(TreeNode* &root1)
