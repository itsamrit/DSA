🟢If we need to start a fresh traversing from topmost root for each node our soln is o(n^2) i,e data till parent node is not used by child node then not dp
or data of leaf to child node is not used in parent node.

else we are using data till parent node in child node or or data of leaf to child node is used in parent node. then solution is called dp i,e o(n)


🟢NO FIXED FORMAT to make dp soln,(either pre,post or in depends) u need to think considering tree of either 0 node,1 node i,e 1 level ,2 levels , 3 level.
 
 In most cases making dfs for 2 or 3 level solves problem for whole

👉In BFS,while using normal queue we can fix the size of each loop if required while(q.size()){ sz=q.size(); for(int i=0 to sz)..}

When using priority_queue/multiset/set we dont fix the size of loop as priority queue changes at each iteration. while(pq.size()) NO sz defined


👉All questions can be solved with int,TreeNode* dfs except printing all paths or nodes but all questions cant be solved without any parameter i,e void.
void and int,TreeNode* dfs have same tc since we are not using extenal dp array like in combination.

👉If data of nodes is not only affected by left or right child but also by parent node or any other node u need to link all nodes with parent nodes to make it like graph to traverse.
If u want data saved in parent node use &data while passing in dfs & u will get data without linking to parent node.

👉Subtree tc o(n*m)

👉There is all left element strictly lesser & right stictly greater than root just like sorted array.

All elements of BST are unique.

👉Never return between loop either at starting or at end (not applicable for dp)
Other wise chaos like binary tree path wrong answers

Both in diameter & lcs u cant store distance or node using & of left & right or not do
lca is also dp cant be solved using void

👉 In tree Bfs we dont write loop for all conneted nodes instead we directlly write algo for left & right

👉 Pass & in tree just like we pass normally void dfs(TreeNode* &root1)
