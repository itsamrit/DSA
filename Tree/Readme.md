ðŸ‘‰All questions can be solved with int,TreeNode* dfs except printing all paths or nodes but all questions cant be solved without any parameter i,e void.
void and int,TreeNode* dfs have same tc since we are not using extenal dp array like in combination.

ðŸ‘‰If you data of nodes which is not left or right child i,e, parent node or any other node u need to link all nodes with parent nodes to make it like graph to traverse.
If u want data saved in parent node use &data while passing in dfs & u will get data without linking to parent node.

ðŸ‘‰All questions in binary tree with 1 recursion are dp void & int all Tc =o(n)âœ…âœ…

ðŸ‘‰Subtree tc o(n*m)

ðŸ‘‰There is all left element strictly lesser & right stictly greater than root just like sorted array.

All elements of BST are unique.

ðŸ‘‰Never return between loop either at starting or at end (not applicable for dp)
Other wise chaos like binary tree path wrong answers

Both in diameter & lcs u cant store distance or node using & of left & right or not do
lca is also dp cant be solved using void

ðŸ‘‰ In tree Bfs we dont write loop for all conneted nodes instead we directlly write algo for left & right

ðŸ‘‰ Pass & in tree just like we pass normally void dfs(TreeNode* &root1)
