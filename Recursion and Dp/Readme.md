âœ…âœ…Error : Never use bool or int as boolean in recursion while memoization.

eg: Can we place n no adjacent. Find no of people we can place if greater then return true int dfs()

âœ…âœ…1d or 2d dp is determined by no of variable parameters in void dfs(....)

âœ…âœ…Count of all incresing(length not specified) can be done using memoization but count of longest (length fixed) can be done using tabulation only.


âœ…âœ…Backtracking is done same way in both memoization & tabulation. First run dp & then run another loop to backtrack the dp vector.

âœ…âœ…Whenever u are writing code for matrix which can go more than 2 directions u need to maintain a visited matrix like u do in graph.[Endless loop i,e Stackoverflow Error]

eg: In memoization: dfs(nums,dp);   while(..)loop for backtracking.

In tabulation : for(for(..)  while(..) loop for backtracking

âœ”âœ” If not asked to print all recursion can be converted to dp











If you are doing dp i,e storing data by using non-void recursive like int, then u need to do operations after the call.

âœ”âœ”To write recursion just think mainly 2 edge case : To write base case 1st if array contains 0 elements & 

2nd to write rest think if 1 element is present in array 






ðŸ‘‰Write boundry conditions i,e variable value either at starting or before calling recursion or half at starting & half before calling recursion. 

eg : if(i<0 && mat[i][j]==0)return;   

eg : if(vis[i]==0) dfs();

ðŸ‘‰Write base condition i,e static value where to return something. eg: if(i==0)return 0;

ðŸ‘‰Marking visited & backtracking for checking all possible solutions -:

  â€¢In graph represent as adjacency && in matrix path (directions)finding list u can only mark visited in starting i,e before for loop && unmark it for backtracking to get all solutions after loop ends.
  
  Else if u will not mark firstly it will go again to its own vertex. Since for (all child)

  â€¢In normal matrix like chessboard & in graph represented as matrix u can only mark visited inside the loop && unmark it for backtracking also inside the loop.
  
  Because if u mark it firstly outside it will check  for(i=0 to n rows) then whole 0th row will be not itracted . Since it is marked.
      
  â€¢In rest question you can either outside loop or inside loop


ðŸ‘‰Permutation & Matrix combinationn/permutation matrix repre asgraph does not depend on whats upper can come again  to place a thing is similar & 
but in combination & path (both matrix, graph & tree)depends on upper


ðŸ‘‰ In comination subset eg:knapsack u need to check before calling if(wt-wiei >0) becuae erroe if push_back(temp[i]) & only 

& so u can  return in starting only on i==0 push-back + return  not if(i<0) return

ðŸ‘‰Whenever u write int funt in binary tree all memoization & tabulation is also possibile becuae of it u need to return at last something of function like in binary tree & combination subset
