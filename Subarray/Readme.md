âœ…âœ…ðŸ‘‰ If a subarray becomes valid again by adding left elements which are already deleted earlier then it cant be solved by sliding window.Solve it by recursion.

eg: Substring with frequency of each character atleast k. acca & k=2.If we delete a & then go further then it agains become valid if we add a in cca.


ðŸ‘‰ IF you need to pick either from left or right at each step there will subarray in middle so its a subarray prob.

ðŸ‘‰ All subarray prob excepth this 4 types and printing are done by dp

ðŸ‘‰ For hashing char to int : s[i]-'a' because a-'a'=0  Any character minus itself is 0 in coding except integers(never used).

ðŸ‘‰ â—‰ Since we dont intialize our map before loop we keep updating it in 1st line i,e in starting in our loop.

â—‰ We can also initialize our map before loop & then keep updating it in last line inside the loop. Loop will run till i=0 to i<n in both cases.

TO FIND ITERATOR OF SET & MAP SIMILAR TO VECTOR *i > *(i-1)
ðŸ¤œ

âœ…Except these problems all other subarray problem solved by dp except printing all subarray
