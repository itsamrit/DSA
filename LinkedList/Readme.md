✔ Always make a null node & a pointer point the next to head eg: temp->next=head; temp2=temp; to do while(temp->next);   return temp2->next instead of head(to avoid error)

✔ While reversing remember next=cur->next(first line)

✔ Merge K sorted lists = Run a for loop & call a function to merge 2 lists each time
