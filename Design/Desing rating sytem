MUST DO QUESTION TO UNDERSTAND NESTED MAP,SET, and priority queue
map<int,int> is actually set<pair<int,int>> so tc doesnt effected even if u use map 
https://leetcode.com/problems/design-a-food-rating-system/description/
Always use map instead of set and priority queue all have same time complexity 

set is use to just find whether present or not or to sort but both these can be performed by map .
map<int, set<pair<int, string>>> m; // used to find lowest or highest sorted 
map<int , map<int,string>>m;
use rbegin and rend to use descend ing order
