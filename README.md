lexographically maximum no subset more than 10 questions with different just remember it is solved by stack

ðŸ‘‰ for(auto &i:mapp) Use &i otherwise iterator will remain on 1st element

ðŸ‘‰ ROWs == RECORDs while column means attributes

??? all interval questions sort and then make pair<int,int>temp; to compare and make new intervals


BUT once rejected/deleted element for current is then rejected for all other element
IN NGR  element which is not next greater than current cant be next greater for the rest behind it

ðŸ‘‰Thumb rule : Always intialize the queue,stack,map etc before the doing any operation on it in loops.

ðŸ‘‰Iterators:

for(auto i:m) i.first i.second

for(auto i=m.begin(); i!=m.end(); i++) m

ðŸ‘‰ If 2 or more arrays or numbers in questions for comparision like A & B.

Always make 1 smaller if(A>B) swap(A,B) & then solve accordingly.
