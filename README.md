ROWs == RECORDs while column means attributes

??? all interval questions sort and then make pair<int,int>temp; to compare and make new intervals

??? ???stacks question defintiin + similar to code is similar to variable size subarray but (THERE iS no window)in stack we dont make 2 pointer we start iterating from current lement to already iterated but not rejected no window 

lexographically maximum no subset more than 10 questions with different just remember it is solved by stack


BUT once rejected/deleted element for current is then rejected for all other element
IN NGR  element which is not next greater than current cant be next greater for the rest behind it


New question solve in leetcode and make notes there only

ðŸ‘‰Thumb rule : Always intialize the queue,stack,map etc before the doing any operation on it in loops.

ðŸ‘‰Iterators:

for(auto i:m) i.first i.second

for(auto i=m.begin(); i!=m.end(); i++) m

ðŸ‘‰ If 2 or more arrays or numbers in questions for comparision like A & B.

Always make 1 smaller if(A>B) swap(A,B) & then solve accordingly.


ðŸ‘‰ Subarray problems can be solved either by dp or by hashing(vector or unormap) with or without sliding window
