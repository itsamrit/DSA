ðŸŸ¢Learn the techniques of all question which method will be used so that even implementation fails,u get points

ðŸŸ¢For online round :

To convert int to long long : long long new= (long long)old;  & vice versa i,e int new = (int)old;

int to string : to_string(num);

string to int : stoi(str);

char to int & int to char : -'0' - 'a' respectively

ðŸŸ¢Only normal queue & deque has front back
  
lexographically maximum no subset more than 10 questions with different just remember it is solved by stack

ðŸ‘‰ for(auto &i:mapp) Use &i otherwise iterator will remain on 1st element

ðŸ‘‰ ROWs == RECORDs while column means attributes

ðŸ‘‰In Matrix's 4 way travelling if(vis[i][j]) return; is not tle for dfs(i-1,j) & dfs(i,j-1);

BUT once rejected/deleted element for current is then rejected for all other element
IN NGR  element which is not next greater than current cant be next greater for the rest behind it

ðŸ‘‰Thumb rule : Always intialize the queue,stack,map etc before the doing any operation on it in loops.

ðŸ‘‰Iterators:

for(auto i:m) i.first i.second

for(auto i=m.begin(); i!=m.end(); i++) m

ðŸ‘‰ If 2 or more arrays or numbers in questions for comparision like A & B.

Always make 1 smaller if(A>B) swap(A,B) & then solve accordingly.

ðŸ‘‰ Never do modulo as %10^7+7 [Error]. Instead do %1000007

ðŸ‘‰lower_bound(v.begin(),v.end(),val) gives index of 1st occurence of val if present
