New question solve in leetcode and make notes there only

ðŸ‘‰Thumb rule : Always intialize the queue,stack,map etc before the doing any operation on it in loops.

ðŸ‘‰Iterators:

for(auto i:m) i.first i.second

for(auto i=m.begin(); i!=m.end(); i++) m

ðŸ‘‰ If 2 or more arrays or numbers in questions for comparision like A & B.

Always make 1 smaller if(A>B) swap(A,B) & then solve accordingly.


ðŸ‘‰ Subarray problems can be solved either by dp or by hashing(vector or unormap) with or without sliding window
