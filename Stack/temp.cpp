palylist of youtube stack


?? ???stacks question defintiin + similar to code is similar to variable size subarray but (THERE iS no window)in stack we dont make 2 pointer we start iterating from current lement to already iterated but not rejected no window

lexographically maximum no subset more than 10 questions with different just remember it is solved by stack

BUT once rejected/deleted element for current is then rejected for all other element IN NGR element which is not next greater than current cant be next greater for the rest behind it

New question solve in leetcode and make notes there only
