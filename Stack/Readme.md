Famous problems : 1st Next greater ,
                  2nd calculator
                  3rd type is any question where adjacent can be deleted & new adjacent formed may be deleted
                  4th type Score of Parenthesis

游릴1st type : Next greater element or Larget possible number from string maintains the stack as monotonically increasing.Each element of stack is smaller than prev element in next greater


游릴3rd type is any question where adjacent can be deleted & new adjacent formed may be deleted   :
   游릴Code changes according to question, but it can be solved in o(n)
 Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
 Output: "aa"
 use stack<pair<char,int>>st; & run for loop & if current char is same as previous update count of top & else if st.push(new char) && now check if(st.top==k) pop

ASTEROID COLLISION IS also example of this


游릴4th type : Score of Parentheses :-
"()" has score 1.
AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
(A) has score 2 * A


 int scoreOfParentheses(string s) {
        int depth=0,ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++){
            if(s[i]=='('){
                depth++;
            }
            else{
                depth--; 
                if(i!=0 && s[i-1]=='('){
                    ans+=pow(2,depth); //take score of all upper nested ((( && coming ))) attached to its
                }
                //else its score is already included into ans as we take whole score of upper nested while finding lowest level () 
            }
        }
        return ans;
}
