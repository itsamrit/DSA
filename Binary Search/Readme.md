ðŸŸ¢Inclusive binary serc algo i,e if start or end are target then it has abilty to find them. 

For that inclusivity,Specify the target u are searching for all edge case if its inddex i,e like 

while(start<=end) //(<= : To also check left & right instead of only checking index betw them INCLUSIVITY)

if((mid==0 || nums[mid-1]<nums[mid]))   //ðŸŸ¢define target for edge cases such that while writing else if & else we are damn sure its not mid i,e write else if mid-1 & mid+1

else if() r=mid-1;  

else l = mid+1;

ðŸ‘‰while(left<=right) mid=(left+right)/2  =  left + (right-left)/2 [both are totally same in all cases][used for int overflow];


ðŸ‘‰Universal truth = upper - lower = no of elements present of given value

ðŸ‘‰lower_bound(v.begin(),v.end(),val) gives index of 1st occurence of val if present

ðŸ‘‰upper_bound gives last occurence + 1 index if present otherwise upper & lower bound gives any random index but universal truth is true here as well
