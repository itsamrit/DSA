👉while(left<=right) mid=left + (right-left)/2;

👉Universal truth = upper - lower = no of elements present of given value

👉lower_bound(v.begin(),v.end(),val) gives index of 1st occurence of val if present

👉upper_bound gives last occurence + 1 index if present otherwise upper & lower bound gives any random index but universal truth is true here as well
