1.Specify the target u are searching for all edge case if its inddex 

1.inclusive binary serc algo i,e if start or end are target then it has abilty to find them.

ðŸ‘‰WE COMPARE MID WITH RIGHTMOST ELEMENT while serching pivot element in rotated sorted array. NO USE OF LEFT element.

ðŸ‘‰while(left<=right) mid=(left+right)/2  =  left + (right-left)/2 [both are totally same in all cases][used for int overflow];

ðŸ‘‰Universal truth = upper - lower = no of elements present of given value

ðŸ‘‰lower_bound(v.begin(),v.end(),val) gives index of 1st occurence of val if present

ðŸ‘‰upper_bound gives last occurence + 1 index if present otherwise upper & lower bound gives any random index but universal truth is true here as well
